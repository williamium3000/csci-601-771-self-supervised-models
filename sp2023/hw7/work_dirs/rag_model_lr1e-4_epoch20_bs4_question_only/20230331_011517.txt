/u/yli8/.conda/envs/pytorch2.0/lib/python3.8/site-packages/transformers/models/bart/configuration_bart.py:179: UserWarning: Please make sure the config includes `forced_bos_token_id=0` in future versions. The config can simply be saved and uploaded again to be fixed.
  warnings.warn(
Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/rag-token-nq were not used when initializing RagSequenceForGeneration: ['rag.question_encoder.question_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.bias', 'rag.question_encoder.question_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing RagSequenceForGeneration from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing RagSequenceForGeneration from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of RagSequenceForGeneration were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/rag-token-nq and are newly initialized: ['rag.generator.lm_head.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
